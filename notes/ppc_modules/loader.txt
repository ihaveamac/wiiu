loader.elf is one of the few non-rpx/rpl binaries found on the Wiiu. It contains
a RPL/RPX parser, relocator/linker, and some other stuff related to shared area.

The first thing the loader entrypoint does is check a flag whether or not it is
running under "usermode". If it is running under usermode, it means that a user
application has already been loaded, and has sent a command request. This is
done using the 0x4F00 user-syscall.

If it's not running under usermode, it does its init things such as setting up
shared area and preloading RPL's. It also starts an RPX.

== Loader request structure ==

These are the requests that can be made to loader.elf via syscall 0x4F00.
coreinit puts the request on a stack buffer, and then moves a ptr to that into
r3 before doing the syscall. The 6th u32 @ buf is called the command id. The
size of the request buffer is 8*4=32 bytes, plus some random things in a header.

The requests are handled by the function LOADER_Entry. When the entrypoint is
called, r4 contains the ptr to a struct that looks like this:

   u32 inited_zero_by_coreinit; // This is verified/filled in partially by kernel?
   u32 process_id;              // kernel?
   u32 inited_zero_by_coreinit;
   u32 context_ptr;             // kernel?
   u32 inited_zero_by_coreinit;
   u32 old_interrupt_mask;      // coreinit
   u32 request_buf[8];          // This comes from coreinit.

The commands are as follows:

+-----------+---------------------+-------------------
| Command # | Name                | Description
+-----------+---------------------+-------------------
|         1 | Prep                | Updates heartbeat via syscall, then loads an RPL?
|       2,3 | Setup               | "Sets up" a module?
|         4 | Link                |
|         5 | Query               |
|         6 | Tag                 |
|         7 | GainUserControl     |
|         8 | Done                |
|         9 | GetHeapStatistics   |
|       0xA | Panic1?             |
|       0xB | Panic2?             |
